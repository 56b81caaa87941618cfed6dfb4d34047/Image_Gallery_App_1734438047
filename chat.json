        "content": "\nI have created a staking smart contract named \"staking_contract\" based on your instructions. Here's a summary of what I did:\n\n1. Implemented functions for staking, withdrawing, and distributing rewards.\n2. Used OpenZeppelin's IERC20, SafeERC20, and Ownable contracts for token interactions and access control.\n3. Included a reward calculation system based on the time tokens are staked.\n4. Added events for important actions (Staked, Withdrawn, RewardPaid, RewardRateUpdated).\n5. Implemented a function to update the reward rate, accessible only by the contract owner.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract uses placeholder addresses for staking and reward tokens. You need to replace these with actual token addresses before deployment.\n- The initial reward rate is set to 100 tokens per second. Adjust this value as needed before deployment.\n- The contract assumes that the staking token and reward token are different. If they are the same, you may need to modify the contract slightly.\n\nInstructions for deployment and interaction:\n1. Replace the placeholder token addresses in the constructor with actual ERC20 token addresses.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that the contract has a sufficient balance of reward tokens to distribute.\n4. Users can interact with the contract by calling the stake(), withdraw(), and getReward() functions.\n5. The contract owner can update the reward rate using the setRewardRate() function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider a professional audit before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
